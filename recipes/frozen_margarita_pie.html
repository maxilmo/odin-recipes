<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <h3>Crust:</h3>
  <li>1 cup finely crushed pretzels</li>
  <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
  <li>⅓ cup margarine, melted</li>
  <h3>Filling:</h3>
  <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
  <li>⅓ cup frozen limeade concentrate, thawed</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons tequila</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon orange liqueur</li>
  <li>3 drops green food coloring, or as needed (Optional)</li>
  <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
  <li>1 lime, sliced (Optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
  <li>
    Mix pretzels and sugar together in a bowl; stir in margarine until evenly
    incorporated. Spoon mixture into a 9-inch pie plate; press into the bottom
    and sides of the plate to form a firm, even crust.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bake crust in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, about 5
    minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mix sweetened condensed milk, limeade concentrate, tequila, orange liqueur,
    and green food coloring in a large bowl.
  </li>
  <li>
    Beat cream in a glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater
    or whisk straight up: whipped cream should form soft mounds rather than a
    sharp peak. Fold whipped cream into sweetened condensed milk mixture. Spoon
    filling into cooled crust.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cover pie with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, about 4 hours. Let stand
    for 10 minutes before serving; garnish with lime slices.
  </li>
</ol>
