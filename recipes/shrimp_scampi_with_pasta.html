<h2>What Is Shrimp Scampi?</h2>
<p>
  Shrimp scampi is a seafood dish made of shrimp cooked in a butter, garlic, and
  white wine sauce. You can serve shrimp scampi by itself as an appetizer or
  over pasta as a main dish.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Shrimp: Choose large shrimp (31 to 35 shrimp per pound) to get best results
    for this recipe.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pasta: This recipe uses a 16-ounce package of linguine, but you can
    substitute the pasta of your choice, like angel hair pasta, fettuccine, or
    spaghetti.
  </li>
  <li>
    Butter: Use unsalted butter. You can add salt to taste later in the recipe.
  </li>
  <li>
    Extra-virgin olive oil: The flavor of the olive oil comes through in this
    recipe, so use the best quality.
  </li>
  <li>
    Shallots and garlic: These aromatics add flavor and fragrance to shrimp
    scampi.
  </li>
  <li>
    White wine: Use a dry, crisp white wine for shrimp scampi sauce. Pinot
    grigio or sauvignon blanc are good choices, and you can drink the leftover
    wine with dinner.
  </li>
  <li>Lemon juice: Use freshly squeezed lemon juice for the best flavor.</li>
  <li>
    Seasonings: Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper amplify the flavors,
    and a pinch of dried red pepper flakes give shrimp scampi a subtle kick. Use
    more red pepper flakes if you like things a bit more spicy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Parsley: Fresh parsley adds eye-catching color and a bright, peppery flavor.
  </li>
</ul>
